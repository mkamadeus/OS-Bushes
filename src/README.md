# The `src` directory

This is where the implementations of the operating system will be stored. The use of each subfolder is as follows:
* `ext` - Shell and external programs will reside here.
* `kernel` - Kernel related programs will be located here.
* `lib` - Library in header files and its implementation will reside here.
